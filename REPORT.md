## Problem

## Features

Our project mainly evaluates Java Code that is available in github repository. As shown in the image, below are all the available metrics that are project visualizes :-

## Reflection

## Limitations

Our project only evaluates the metrics for Java projects only. This project can also be extended for other languages to study majorly all the repositories available in the github. 

Some more metrics can also be added to get a much more overview of the quality of the code like 

Duplicate Code<br/> 
Dead Code<br/>
Unneccessary Conditional Statements in the code <br/>
Unneccessary variables and methods used, etc.
