## Problem

## Features

Our project mainly evaluates Java Code that is available in github repository. As shown in the image, below are all the available metrics that are project visualizes :-

The first metric shown below is the Total number of comments in every file. So seeing this you can have a good view on how much documentation is done by class.

The next metric shown below is total number of methods per class per file. Here you can easily visualize on how modular the file is in the project.

The next metric shown below is Cyclomatic Complexity per class. More the cyclomatic complexity, worse it is. So after seeing the visualizations you could work on thode specific classes to decrease this metric.

The below graph is the total collaborators for the project. And the name on the point in the graph is the name of the major collaborator at that particular time.

The next graph is the total number of lines per class. It will give you a good view on how much large each class is in the project.

The next image shows the hierarchy diagram of all the classes with there parent class.

The last metric is the coupling among the classes. High coupling is a negative sign with respect to the complexity of the code.

## Reflection

## Limitations

Our project only evaluates the metrics for Java projects only. This project can also be extended for other languages to study majorly all the repositories available in the github. 

Some more metrics can also be added to get a much more overview of the quality of the code like 

Duplicate Code<br/> 
Dead Code<br/>
Unneccessary Conditional Statements in the code <br/>
Unneccessary variables and methods used, etc.
